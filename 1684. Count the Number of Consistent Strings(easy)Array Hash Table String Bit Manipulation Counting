1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings
You are given a string allowed consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings words. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string allowed.
Return the number of consistent strings in the array words.

Example 1:
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

Example 2:
Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.

Example 3:
Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.

class Solution {
    public int countConsistentStrings(String allowed, String[] words) {
        int arr[]=new int[26];
        for(char i:allowed.toCharArray()){
            arr[i-'a']=1;
        }
        int count=0;
        for(String k:words){
            count+=findConsistentString(arr,k);
        }
        return count;
    }
    public static int findConsistentString(int arr[],String k){
        int flag=1;
        for(int i=0;i<k.length();i++){
            if(arr[k.charAt(i)-'a']==0){
                flag=0;
                break;
            }
        }
        return flag;
    }
}
