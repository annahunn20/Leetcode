1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences
Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.
Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")

Example 2:
Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".

Example 3:
Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
