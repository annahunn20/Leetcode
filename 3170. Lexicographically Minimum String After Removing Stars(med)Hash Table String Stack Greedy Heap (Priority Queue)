3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars
You are given a string s. It may contain any number of '*' characters. Your task is to remove all '*' characters.
While there is a '*', do the following operation:
Delete the leftmost '*' and the smallest non-'*' character to its left. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.
Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all '*' characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aaba*"
Output: "aab"
Explanation:
We should delete one of the 'a' characters with '*'. If we choose s[3], s becomes the lexicographically smallest.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abc"
Output: "abc"
Explanation:
There is no '*' in the string.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists only of lowercase English letters and '*'.

class Solution {
    public String clearStars(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        byte[] sc = new byte[n + 1];
        s.getBytes(0, n, sc, 0);
        sc[n] = '*';    // Extra '*' past end of string so no
                        //   limit checking needed in FOR loop.
        
        // Scan the string to get count of asterisks in the 
        // string.  When encountering an asterisk, if half of 
        // the characters from that asterisk back to the 
        // beginning of the string are asterisks, then the string 
        // from the start through that asterisk have an equal 
        // number of letters and asterisks, so that all of the 
        // characters up through that asterisk will be deleted, 
        // so set the start index for processing the string to 
        // the index after that asterisk.
        //
        // If no asterisks in the string, then return the string 
        // itself.  If exactly half of the characters in the 
        // string are asterisks, then the entire string will be 
        // deleted so return the empty string.

                    start = i + 1;
            }
        }
        if (asteriskCount == 0)  return s;
        if (start == n)  return "";

        // Set character values to zero to mark as deleted.
        // The array linkedLists[] contains linked lists, which

        // Build the result string by removing deleted characters
