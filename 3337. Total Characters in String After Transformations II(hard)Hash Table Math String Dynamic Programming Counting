3337. Total Characters in String After Transformations II
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, an integer t representing the number of transformations to perform, and an array nums of size 26. In one transformation, every character in s is replaced according to the following rules:
Replace s[i] with the next nums[s[i] - 'a'] consecutive characters in the alphabet. For example, if s[i] = 'a' and nums[0] = 3, the character 'a' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in "bcd".
The transformation wraps around the alphabet if it exceeds 'z'. For example, if s[i] = 'y' and nums[24] = 3, the character 'y' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in "zab".
Return the length of the resulting string after exactly t transformations.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]
Output: 7
Explanation:
First Transformation (t = 1):
'a' becomes 'b' as nums[0] == 1
'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
Second Transformation (t = 2):
'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
'd' becomes 'e' as nums[3] == 1
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.

Example 2:
Input: s = "azbk", t = 1, nums = [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 8
Explanation:
First Transformation (t = 1):
'a' becomes 'bc' as nums[0] == 2
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
'b' becomes 'cd' as nums[1] == 2
'k' becomes 'lm' as nums[10] == 2
String after the first transformation: "bcabcdlm"
Final Length of the string: The string is "bcabcdlm", which has 8 characters.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= t <= 109
nums.length == 26
1 <= nums[i] <= 25

        /*
        observation: 
        since the only thing that matters is the length of the string after transformations and 
        the transformations impact each individual character of the current s state independently and the position/order
        does not impact the transformation, only the letters, the order of s is irrelevant, only need to pay attention to the counts of every letter. 

        can reduce s to a sz 26 vector counting freq of every letter in s.
        Instead of transforming s, can transform vector counts.

        have oldCnt and newCnt vectors for before and after transform
        newCnt[i] = [sum over all k < 26 where nums[i-k] >= k (including wrap around mod k) of oldCnt[i-k]]

        such a transformation seems linear and seems like we can construct a matrix to do through matrix mult
        matrix mult is equiv to multiplying each col of matrix by old vector cooresponding so can construct matrix by filling each 
        index's cooresponding value column with ones from row (i+1) % 26 to (i+nums[i]) % 26

        using such a matrix A can mult A*old = new
        thus have A^t * old = new_t_transformed.

        So problem is reduced to matrix exponentiation of A^t
