3403. Find the Lexicographically Largest String From the Box I
You are given a string word, and an integer numFriends.
Alice is organizing a game for her numFriends friends. There are multiple rounds in the game, where in each round:
word is split into numFriends non-empty strings, such that no previous round has had the exact same split.
All the split words are put into a box.
Find the lexicographically largest string from the box after all the rounds are finished.

Example 1:
Input: word = "dbca", numFriends = 2
Output: "dbc"
Explanation: 
All possible splits are:
"d" and "bca".
"db" and "ca".
"dbc" and "a".

Example 2:
Input: word = "gggg", numFriends = 4
Output: "g"
Explanation: 
The only possible split is: "g", "g", "g", and "g".
Constraints:
1 <= word.length <= 5 * 103
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= numFriends <= word.length

    public String lastSubstring(String s) {
        int i = 0, j = 1, n = s.length();
        while (j < n) {
            int k = 0;
            while (j + k < n && s.charAt(i + k) == s.charAt(j + k)) {
                k++;
            }

                int t = i;
                i = j;
                j = Math.max(j + 1, t + k + 1);
            } else {
                j = j + k + 1;
            }
        }
        return s.substring(i);
    }

    public String answerString(String word, int numFriends) {
        if (numFriends == 1) {
            return word;
        }
        String last = lastSubstring(word);
        int n = word.length(), m = last.length();
        return last.substring(0, Math.min(m, n - numFriends + 1));
    }
